# How co-ops work in Australia

---

## The Basics
A **co-operative** in Australia is a legal business structure owned and controlled by its members, not external shareholders. Its core purpose must benefit the members (not just investors).

There are **two main types**:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Distributing co-op (DC)** | Can return profits to members (dividends, rebates, patronage payments). |
| **Non-distributing co-op (NDC)** | Profits must be reinvested back into the co-op’s purpose (often used for community, education, social enterprise). |

## Who Regulates Co-ops?
Co-ops operate under the **Co-operatives National Law (CNL)** in most states and territories.

**Jurisdictions using CNL:**
- NSW  
- [VIC](/resources/registration/state-gov/australia/victoria)
- QLD
- SA 
- TAS
- ACT
- NT  

**WA has its own co-operatives act**, but it’s similar in practice.

The regulator differs by state (e.g., Department of Fair Trading / Consumer Affairs).

## Core legal requirements
To register a co-operative in Australia, you need:

### 1. A purpose  
Must clearly define how the co-op benefits its members.

### 2. Active membership rule  
Members must do something to contribute — for example:  
- buy or supply goods/services  
- contribute labour or participation  
- pay regular subscriptions  
- vote / participate in governance  

Members who stop being *active* can be removed.

### 3. Minimum membership
- **5 members** to start (individuals or organisations)
- **1 vote per member** regardless of capital contribution — fundamental principle

### 4. Rules / constitution
Must follow the CNL template or equivalent. Rules cover:
- membership requirements  
- board composition and elections  
- dispute resolution  
- finances and profit distribution  
- winding up  

### 5. Board requirements
- Minimum **3 directors**
- **Majority must live in Australia**
- Directors have similar duties to company directors

### 6. Naming
Must include **“Co-operative” or “Co-op”** in the legal name.

## Financial & Reporting
Reporting obligations depend on the size and type of the co-op:

| Scale | Reporting expectation |
|-------|------------------------|
| **Small (most)** | Simplified financial reports; can often avoid full audit |
| **Large or distributing** | Full annual financial reporting and typically an audit |
| **Co-ops raising capital from public** | Greater disclosure rules, similar to companies |

## Advantages of Co-ops
- Member-controlled (1 member = 1 vote)
- Profit can stay in the community
- Strong model for **shared ownership / mutualisation**
- Better cultural fit for **purpose-driven organisations** than Pty Ltd
- Can pay member dividends (if distributing)

## Limitations
- Decision-making can be slower than a traditional startup
- Governance must be transparent and well-documented
- Profit return restricted for non-distributing co-ops
- Not designed for venture capital investment

## Best Use Cases
Co-ops are common in:
- Agriculture  
- Housing  
- Energy  
- Education and training  
- Healthcare and disability support  
- Mutual insurance and risk pools  
- Digital platforms / worker collectives  
- Community-owned assets  

They’re increasingly used for **platform and DAO-style shared ownership** because the framework aligns with democratic governance.

## Forming One (practical sequence)
1. Decide **distributing** or **non-distributing**
2. Draft **rules** + **disclosure statement** (for DC only)
3. Recruit **at least 5** founding members
4. Hold **formation meeting**
5. File **application + fees** with your state regulator
6. After registration — open bank account, onboard members, elect board
