# Welcome to the selfdriven Foundation Cooperative

The **selfdriven Foundation Cooperative** exists to support people and communities to grow, learn and self-actuate — together.

We are **member-owned**, **member-governed** and **mission-driven**.

---

## What we stand for

- Curiosity, care, and lifelong learning  
- Fairness and shared governance  
- Privacy, autonomy and digital dignity  
- Community benefit over extraction  
- Ethical, human-aligned technology  

Our formal rules are set out in the [Constitution](/constitution). This page is the plain-language overview.

---

## How membership works

- Anyone aligned with the mission and principles can apply.  
- Each member has **one vote**, regardless of contribution size.  
- As a member, you can:
  - participate in key decisions and elections;
  - join or form working circles;
  - contribute skills, time, funding, or infrastructure;
  - help shape the evolution of the selfdriven ecosystem.

You’re expected to act in good faith, uphold the guiding principles, and follow the Constitution and policies.

## How decisions get made

- The **General Assembly** (all members) is the highest authority.  
- The **Board of Stewards** looks after legal, financial and risk responsibilities, and implements member decisions.  
- **Circles** handle specific areas (e.g. tech, community, education, governance) with delegated authority.

Meetings and voting can happen online using secure digital tools and verifiable identity where appropriate.

## How surplus is used

The Cooperative reinvests in the mission — not in extracting profit.

Surplus is allocated to:

1. Operational sustainability and reserves;  
2. Community and ecosystem support;  
3. Equitable member patronage distributions, if approved by members.

No member is entitled to profit beyond fair and equitable participation.

---

## Your identity and your data

- You own your identity and personal data.  
- The Cooperative supports privacy-preserving and self-sovereign identity technologies, including verifiable credentials.  
- Participation should not require unnecessary or intrusive data collection.

Further details are described in the Constitution and related policies.

---

## Leaving and accountability

- You may leave the Cooperative at any time by resigning your membership.  
- Behaviour that seriously harms the Cooperative or breaches the rules can result in suspension or expulsion, with a fair process and a right to appeal.

## The spirit of the Cooperative

We are building an ecosystem where learning, technology, governance and community reinforce one another.

- Everyone belongs.  
- Everyone can contribute.  
- Everyone should benefit from the progress we make together.

If you have questions about joining, responsibilities, or your rights as a member, please refer to the [Constitution](/templates/selfdriven/coop/constitution) or contact the Cooperative.
