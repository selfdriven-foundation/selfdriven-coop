# ByLaws — selfdriven Foundation Cooperative
_(Operational rules that sit under the Constitution)_

These ByLaws describe **how the Cooperative functions day-to-day**. Where there is any conflict, the **Constitution takes precedence**.

---

## 1. Interpretation & Scope
- These ByLaws apply to all members, Circles, committees, working groups and elected representatives.
- The Board of Stewards maintains the current version and may propose amendments to the General Assembly.
- Detailed procedures may be documented in policies without requiring a ByLaws amendment.

---

## 2. Membership — Practical Rules
### 2.1 Joining
- Membership applications must follow the standard application process.
- A short onboarding session or equivalent orientation is required before first voting participation.

### 2.2 Member Participation Expectations
Members are expected to:
- contribute in at least one capacity (time, skills, knowledge, infrastructure or funding);
- act in alignment with guiding principles;
- participate in decision-making when reasonable.

### 2.3 Lapsed / Dormant Membership
- Members with **no engagement for 12 months** may be contacted to confirm intent to remain active.
- After a reasonable attempt at contact, the Membership Circle may recommend suspension to the Board of Stewards.

### 2.4 Resignation & Transfer of Work
- Members who resign must ensure reasonable handover of responsibilities and project assets associated with Cooperative stewardship.

## 3. Governance — Operational Rules
### 3.1 Circles and Committees
- Circles operate with delegated authority granted by the Board or General Assembly.
- Each Circle must maintain:
  - scope and mandate;
  - membership list;
  - meeting rhythm;
  - decision-record-keeping.

### 3.2 Circle Leads
- Leads are selected by Circle members and ratified by the Board.
- Leads may be rotated at least annually to support shared stewardship.

### 3.3 Transparency
- All governance-related decisions must be recorded publicly (or member-only where privacy/safety requires).

## 4. General Assembly — Meeting Rules
The Constitution defines formal powers; these ByLaws define practical operation.

- Notice periods may include delivery via email and digital platforms.
- Discussion may occur asynchronously before a vote.
- Members may submit an agenda item or proposal by:
  - notifying two Stewards, **or**
  - raising it through a Circle with delegated mandate.

**Minimum supporting information for proposals:**
- summary of decision requested;
- rationale and alignment to mission;
- impact assessment (benefits, risks, resourcing);
- proposal of who is responsible for delivery if adopted.

---

## 5. Digital Governance
- Digital meetings, voting and participation tools are valid.
- Verifiable identity (VCs, SSI, wallet-based auth, or equivalent) may be used to confirm membership.
- Anonymous or pseudonymous participation in **discussion** is permitted so long as voting identity is verifiable.

---

## 6. Financial Participation — Operational Rules
- Recognition of non-financial contribution (time, skills, infrastructure) may be quantified using Cooperative-approved contribution models.
- Patronage distribution formulas must be:
  - transparent;
  - calculable by members independently;
  - published before any distribution vote.

- Surplus decisions must always reference:
  1. sustainability,
  2. ecosystem development,
  3. fair member benefit.

---

## 7. Conflict Resolution
- Most issues should be resolved at Circle level where possible.
- If unresolved, escalation path:
  1. Circle Lead(s)
  2. Board of Stewards
  3. independent review (appointed by Board)

- All parties must be heard respectfully; mediation or restorative processes may be used.

---

## 8. Conduct & Accountability
- Behaviour inconsistent with the mission, principles or Constitution may trigger a conduct review.
- Temporary suspension may be applied while a review is underway.
- Sanctions may include warnings, suspension from roles, or membership termination (in accordance with the Constitution).

  - decision/vote records within 7 days;
  - policy updates within 14 days after adoption.

---

## 10. Amendments to these ByLaws
