## Organisational Systems for Cooperatives

Cooperatives succeed when members can **see**, **prove**, and **coordinate** shared value fairly.

The selfdriven Organisational System is designed exactly for that.

### 1. Identity & Membership you can trust

Co-ops need clarity on *who is a member and what rights they hold*.

The system provides:
- Verifiable Member Identity (SSI / KERI)
- Roles & responsibilities as credentials
- Join / exit as signed lifecycle events
- Delegation & proxy representation

*Membership becomes cryptographically anchored instead of manually administered.*

### 2. Contribution Accounting → trust without politics

Co-ops struggle when contribution is invisible.  
The **Octomics proof-of-activity** model makes member effort *verifiable*.

Members can log contributions across 8 activity areas (work, outreach, capital, governance, etc.) and hold verifiable records of participation.  
These can be tied to:
- benefits
- payouts
- influence
- governance weight
- bonuses

*Removes the “who’s doing the work vs who’s getting the reward” friction.*

### 3. Collaborative Governance

Supports all major cooperative governance flows:
- proposals
- elections
- spending approvals
- sub-group formation
- delegated authority

**Features:**
- Transparent proposals
- Configurable voting formulas (1-person-1-vote, role-based, contribution-weighted, delegated, etc.)
- Decisions stored as KERI/ACDC events
- Optional automatic execution triggers (payments, tasks, rights)

*Decisions become tamper-proof, transparent, and replayable.*

### 4. Co-ownership & Shared Assets

Works for shared:
- capital
- equipment
- property
- IP
- blockchain nodes
- digital services

Ownership shares can be:
- Verifiable credentials
- Tokenised (fungible or NFT-based)
- Time / contribution-based vesting
- Delegated or fractional

*New contributors can join without restructuring the whole organisation.*

### 5. Revenue Distribution (without drama)

Configurable without rewriting bylaws every time:
- flat membership base
- Octomics multiplier
- role weighting
- milestone bonuses
- seasonal or outcome-based distribution

*Payments become predictable, fair, and auditable.*

### 6. Cooperative-to-Cooperative Interoperability

Because membership and roles are credentials:
- a farming co-op can work with a brewing co-op
- a solar co-op can work with a housing co-op
- credentials can cross between groups

*Creates federations of co-ownership instead of isolated organisations.*

### 7. AI that supports members — not replaces them

AI services can be community-controlled and permissioned:
- onboarding helpers
- proposal summaries and decision support
- conflict-resolution suggestions
- skills–to–task matching for internal projects

*The AI becomes a **co-op assistant**, not a central authority.*

### What it unlocks

With the system in place, a cooperative becomes:
- easier to start
- easier to run
- cheaper to govern
- safer to grow
- less prone to politics and burnout

Members spend more time **building value**, not **fighting over coordination**.

### Where this fits in the selfdriven ecosystem

| Interface | Value for a Cooperative |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Identity | Fair membership + rights |
| Social | Contribution ecology + belonging |
| Infrastructure | Shared assets + co-ownership |
| Governance | Collective decision-making |
| Finance | Revenue splits + payments |
| Learning | Skill development + apprenticeships |
| AI | Augmentation + support |
| On-chain | Anchor trust + portability |
